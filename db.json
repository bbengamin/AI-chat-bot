              "message": "To process a refund in iMIS, you can follow these steps depending on the payment method and the configuration of your system:\n\n### For Credit Card or ACH Payments (via Global Payments or Stripe Gateways):\n1. Navigate to **Finance > Pay Central > Find Payments**.\n2. Search for the payment you want to refund.\n3. Click the **Payment ID** to open the payment details.\n4. Select **Adjust Payment**.\n5. Ensure the **Adjustment Type** is set to \"Refund the payment.\"\n6. Enter the refund amount (must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the original payment amount).\n7. Add any necessary comments for the refund.\n8. Click **Submit** to process the refund. If using Global Payments, the refund will be issued directly. For other gateways, you may need to process the refund separately in the gateway portal and record it in iMIS.\n\n### For Cash or Check Payments:\n1. Record the refund manually in iMIS to ensure the general ledger accounts remain balanced.\n2. Go to **Finance > Pay Central > Find Payments** and locate the payment.\n3. Adjust the payment as described above, but ensure the refund is also processed through your bank.\n\n### For Credit Invoices:\n1. Navigate to **Finance > Closing Procedures > Credit Invoices**.\n2. Select the invoices to be refunded or use the **Select All** option.\n3. Click **Record Refunds** and confirm the details.\n4. If the refund method is incorrect, check the **Refund Method for Credit Invoices** setting under **Settings > Finance > General**.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure the **Refund Clearing Account** is properly configured under **Settings > Finance > Financial Entities > Default Accounts** to maintain accurate financial records.\n- For event-related refunds, additional steps may be required to adjust registrations or reverse event revenue.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or specific scenarios (e.g., event cancellations, partial refunds), let me know, and I can provide more tailored guidance!",
